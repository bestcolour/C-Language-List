# C-List
 My attempt in recreating C#'s generic list in C language with a program that let's you write different types of list.

 Limitations:
 The ListTypeWriter is unable to create pointer lists. The way to do so (using the typewriter) is for the pointer to be nested inside of a struct and create a struct list.
